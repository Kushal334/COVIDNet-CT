# COVID-Net Open Source Initiative - COVID-Net CT

**Note: The COVID-Net CT models provided here [as part of the COVID-Net Initiative](http://www.covid-net.ml) are intended to be used as reference models that can be built upon and enhanced as new data becomes available. They are currently at a research stage and not yet intended as production-ready models (i.e., not meant for direct clinical diagnosis), and we are working continuously to improve them as new data becomes available. Please do not use COVID-Net CT for self-diagnosis and seek help from your local health authorities.**

**Update 2021-01-26:** We released the [COVID-Net CT-2 models](docs/models.md) and [COVIDx CT-2A and CT-2B](https://www.kaggle.com/hgunraj/covidxct) datasets, comprising 194,922 CT slices from 3,745 patients and 201,103 CT slices from 4,501 patients respectively. The models and dataset are described [in this preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07433).

**Update 2020-12-23:** The [COVID-Net CT-1 paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2020.608525) was published in _Frontiers in Medicine_.

**Update 2020-12-03:** We released the [COVIDx CT-1](https://www.kaggle.com/dataset/c395fb339f210700ba392d81bf200f766418238c2734e5237b5dd0b6fc724fcb/version/1) dataset on Kaggle.

**Update 2020-09-13:** We released a preprint of the [COVID-Net CT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05383).

	<em>Example CT scans of COVID-19 cases and their associated critical factors (highlighted in red) as identified by GSInquire.</em>
</p>

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to have a tremendous impact on patients and healthcare systems around the world. In the fight against this novel disease, there is a pressing need for rapid and effective screening tools to identify patients infected with COVID-19, and to this end CT imaging has been proposed as one of the key screening methods which may be used as a complement to RT-PCR testing, particularly in situations where patients undergo routine CT scans for non-COVID-19 related reasons, patients have worsening respiratory status or developing complications that require expedited care, or patients are suspected to be COVID-19-positive but have negative RT-PCR test results. Early studies on CT-based screening have reported abnormalities in chest CT images which are characteristic of COVID-19 infection, but these abnormalities may be difficult to distinguish from abnormalities caused by other lung conditions. Motivated by this, in this study we introduce COVID-Net CT, a deep convolutional neural network architecture that is tailored for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images via a machine-driven design exploration approach. Additionally, we introduce COVIDx CT, a benchmark CT image dataset derived from a variety of sources of CT imaging data currently comprising 201,103 images across 4,501 patient cases. Furthermore, in the interest of reliability and transparency, we leverage an explainability-driven performance validation strategy to investigate the decision-making behaviour of COVID-Net CT, and in doing so ensure that COVID-Net CT makes predictions based on relevant indicators in CT images. Both COVID-Net CT and the COVIDx CT dataset are available to the general public in an open-source and open access manner as part of the [COVID-Net Initiative](http://www.covid-net.ml). While COVID-Net CT is **not yet a production-ready screening solution**, we hope that releasing the model and dataset will encourage researchers, clinicians, and citizen data scientists alike to leverage and build upon them.
